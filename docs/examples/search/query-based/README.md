# Query Based Search

In this folder, you'll find some examples where we search for courses based on some query string.
Considered examples are:

1. Searching for courses on python
  [Intent](./intents/course_name_intent.json)
  [Catalog](./catalogs/course_name_catalog.json)
2. Searching for courses based on instructor's name (Prof Kannan Moudgalya in this example)
  [Intent](./intents/instructor_name_intent.json)
  [Catalog](./catalogs/instructor_name_catalog.json)
