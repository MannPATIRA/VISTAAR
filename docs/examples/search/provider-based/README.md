# Provider Based Search

In this folder, you'll find some examples where we search for courses from different providers.
Considered examples are:

1. Searching for courses based on instructor's name (Prof Kannan Moudgalya in this example)
  [Intent](./intents/instructor_name_intent.json)
  [Catalog](./catalogs/instructor_name_catalog.json)
