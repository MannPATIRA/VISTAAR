Mulching should be done with crop residue, straw / polythene to conserve soil moisture as well as maintain soil temperature. Avoid grazing of animal during noon hours in open place. Farmers those are already harvested their paddy crops are advised to go for one deep summer ploughing to control insect and pest population and start preparation of field for kharif crop cultivation.",
